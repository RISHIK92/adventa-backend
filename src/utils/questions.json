So, P(X=0) = 4/8 = 1/2.\n- The value X=1 occurs for {HHT, HTH, HTT, THT}. So, P(X=1) = 4/8 = 1/2.\n- X cannot take any other values.\n\nNow, we calculate the mean ($\\mu$) of X:\n$\\mu = \\sum x_i p(x_i) = (0 \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (1 \\times \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the variance ($\\sigma^2$) of X:\n$\\sigma^2 = \\sum x_i^2 p(x_i) - \\mu^2 = ((0^2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (1^2 \\times \\frac{1}{2})) - (\\frac{1}{2})^2$\n$\\sigma^2 = (0 + \\frac{1}{2}) - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the required value:\n$64(\\mu+\\sigma^{2}) = 64(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}) = 64(\\frac{3}{4}) = 16 \\times 3 = 48$.",

A sliding contact is at the middle of the wire, and an external resistor $R_c = 2\\Omega$ is connected from this contact to the negative terminal of the battery.\n1.  **Divide the Potentiometer Wire**: Since the contact is in the middle, the wire is split into two sections of equal resistance: $R_1 = R_2 = R_p/2 = 1\\Omega/2 = 0.5\\Omega$.\n2.  **Analyze the Circuit Configuration**: The first section ($R_1 = 0.5\\Omega$) is in series with the rest of the circuit.

    "solution": "### Analysis of Assertion (A)\nThe fringe width (distance between consecutive bright or dark fringes) in a Young's double-slit experiment (YDSE) is given by the formula $\\beta = \\frac{\\lambda D}{d}$. Here, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light, D is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the distance between the slits.\nWhen the entire apparatus is immersed in an optically denser medium with a refractive index $\\mu > 1$, the wavelength of light in that medium changes to $\\lambda_{medium} = \\frac{\\lambda_{air}}{\\mu}$.\nSince $\\mu > 1$, the wavelength in the medium is less than in air ($\\lambda_{medium} < \\lambda_{air}$).\nThe new fringe width will be $\\beta_{medium} = \\frac{\\lambda_{medium} D}{d} = \\frac{\\lambda_{air} D}{\\mu d} = \\frac{\\beta_{air}}{\\mu}$.\nAs $\\mu > 1$, the fringe width decreases ($\\beta_{medium} < \\beta_{air}$), meaning the fringes come closer together. Thus, **Assertion (A) is true**.\n\n### Analysis of Reason (R)\nWhen light travels from a rarer medium (like air) to an optically denser medium, its speed decreases. The refractive index ($\\mu$) is defined by the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (c) to its speed in the medium (v), i.e., $\\mu = c/v$. The frequency of a light wave is determined by its source and does not change when the medium changes. Since the wave speed is related to frequency (f) and wavelength ($\\lambda$) by $v = f\\lambda$, if v decreases and f remains constant, the wavelength $\\lambda$ must also decrease. Thus, **Reason (R) is true**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Reason (R) provides the correct physical explanation for why the wavelength of light decreases in a denser medium. This decrease in wavelength is the direct cause of the decrease in fringe width mentioned in the Assertion (A). Therefore, **both (A) and (R) are true, and (R) is the correct explanation of (A)**.",
